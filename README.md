# TEXT-SUMMARIZATION-TOOL

*COMPANY*: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: M HEMALATHA

*INTERN ID*: CT04DH940

*DOMAIN*: AI

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*PROJECT OVERVIEW*:
This project presents a beginner-friendly Text Summarization Tool, built entirely in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The aim is to summarize lengthy English text such as articles, essays, or paragraphs into concise summaries using pre-trained transformer models.
Text summarization is a key NLP task used in many real-world applications like summarizing news, reports, and documents. This tool is especially useful for students, researchers, or developers looking for a simple way to generate summaries without needing complex machine learning training or infrastructure. It makes use of the Hugging Face transformers library to run a pre-trained summarization model.

*OBJECTIVE*:
The main goal of this notebook project is to simplify the summarization process using modern tools in an interactive environment. By using Jupyter Notebook, the project provides a step-by-step execution of each line of code, making it ideal for learning and experimentation.
The summarization performed is abstractive, meaning the tool creates new sentences for the summary rather than just copying from the original text. This results in a more natural and human-like summary.

*TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED*:
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for writing and running Python code.
Python 3: The programming language used for scripting.
Transformers (by Hugging Face): For using pre-trained models like BART and T5 for summarization.
PyTorch: Backend library used by the transformer models to perform computations.

*TECHNIQUES USED*:
The summarizer uses Hugging Faceâ€™s pipeline() for abstractive summarization. The pipeline() handles:
  Loading the model and tokenizer
  Preprocessing the text (tokenization)
  Running inference on the model
  Decoding the generated summary
This eliminates the need for building or training a model from scratch.

*REPOSITORIES USED*:
summarizer_transformers.ipynb: Main notebook containing the summarization logic.
README.md: This file describing the project.

*USE CASES*:
Summarizing articles and blogs
Creating quick previews of documents
Helping students summarize academic content
Extracting key ideas from reports
